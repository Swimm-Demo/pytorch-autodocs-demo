# [Converting Tensors to a Strided Representation](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/k87x4ufq#convert_to_strided_representation)

The first step in gradient checking with sparse support is converting the input tensors to a strided representation. This is necessary because gradient computations require a dense format. The conversion process involves materializing unspecified elements with zero values, ensuring that the tensor is ready for gradient computation. This step is crucial for handling sparse tensors, which may have many zero elements that are not explicitly stored.

# [Applying Sparse Masks](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/k87x4ufq#sparse_mask)

After converting tensors to a strided representation, the next step is to apply sparse masks. Sparse masks are used to zero out elements that are not specified in the mask. This is important for operations that need to ignore certain elements, ensuring that only the relevant parts of the tensor are considered during gradient computation. Applying sparse masks helps in maintaining the sparsity of the tensor while performing necessary operations.

# [Verifying Gradients](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/k87x4ufq#gradcheck)

The final step in the process is verifying the gradients. This involves comparing numerical gradients obtained via finite differences with analytical gradients. The verification ensures that the gradients used in optimization are accurate. This step is essential for validating the correctness of gradients in operations involving sparse tensors, providing confidence that the optimization process will perform as expected.
