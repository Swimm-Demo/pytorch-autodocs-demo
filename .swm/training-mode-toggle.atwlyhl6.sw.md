# [Switching the model to training mode](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/vvaabh56#moving-exported-model-to-train-mode)

When the model is switched to training mode, it involves replacing certain operations like dropout and batchnorm with their training counterparts. This ensures that the model behaves correctly during the training phase. Specifically, dropout layers will randomly drop units during training to prevent overfitting, and batchnorm layers will use batch statistics to normalize the data.

# [Switching the model to evaluation mode](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/vvaabh56#_move_exported_model_to_eval)

When the model is switched to evaluation mode, it involves replacing certain operations like dropout and batchnorm with their evaluation counterparts. This ensures that the model behaves correctly during the evaluation phase. Specifically, dropout layers will not drop any units, and batchnorm layers will use running statistics to normalize the data.
