This document will cover the Profiling Process Overview, which includes:

1. Initialization of the profiling process
2. Starting the profiling asynchronously
3. Waiting for the profiling to be in the running state
4. Handling the results after the profiling is stopped.

# [Initialization of the Profiling Process](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/j6jl4pye#profile-initialization)

The profiling process begins by ensuring that no other profiling runs are happening simultaneously. This is done by acquiring a lock. If the lock is successfully acquired, it indicates that no other profiling is in progress, and the process can proceed. This step is crucial to prevent any conflicts or inaccuracies in the profiling data.

# [Starting the Profiling Asynchronously](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/j6jl4pye#starting-strobelight)

Once the lock is acquired, the profiling process starts asynchronously. This means that the profiling runs in the background, allowing other tasks to continue without waiting for the profiling to complete. The system logs the run ID and waits for the profiling to reach the running state.

# [Waiting for the Profiling to be in the Running State](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/j6jl4pye#waiting-for-running-state)

After starting the profiling asynchronously, the system continuously checks the status of the profiling process. It repeatedly queries the status until it confirms that the profiling is running or encounters an error. This ensures that the profiling process is actively monitoring the required functions.

# [Handling the Results After the Profiling is Stopped](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/j6jl4pye#handling-profiling-results)

Once the profiling is complete, the system stops the profiling and collects the results. If any errors occur during this process, they are logged and handled appropriately. The results are then processed and made available for analysis. This step is essential for understanding the performance and behavior of the system during the profiling period.
