title: Training a ConvNeXt Model
---
This document will cover the process of training a ConvNeXt model using the `train_convnext_example` function. We'll cover:

1. Initializing the ConvNeXt model
2. Distributing the model across devices
3. Distributing input and target tensors for training.

# [Initializing the ConvNeXt Model](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/7egh2xb7#initializing-and-distributing-the-convnext-model)

The process begins by setting up the ConvNeXt model with specific parameters such as depths, dimensions, and the number of classes. This step is crucial as it defines the architecture of the model that will be trained. The model is then prepared to be distributed across multiple devices to leverage parallel processing capabilities.

# [Distributing the Model Across Devices](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/7egh2xb7#distributing-module)

Once the ConvNeXt model is initialized, it is distributed across a device mesh. This involves partitioning the model's parameters and buffers so that they can be processed in parallel across multiple devices. This distribution is managed by the `distribute_module` function, which ensures that the model's components are appropriately sharded or replicated to optimize training efficiency.

# [Distributing Input and Target Tensors](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/7egh2xb7#distributing-input-and-target-tensors)

The next step involves distributing the input tensor `x` and the target tensor `y_target` across the device mesh. This ensures that the data is evenly distributed and can be processed in parallel by the distributed model. The `distribute_tensor` function is used to shard or replicate these tensors as needed, facilitating efficient data handling during the training process.
