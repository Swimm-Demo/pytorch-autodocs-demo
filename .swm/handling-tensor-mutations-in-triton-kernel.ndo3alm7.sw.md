# [Identifying Mutated Tensors](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/795rvuez#identifying-mutated-tensors)

The first step in handling tensor mutations is to identify which tensors are mutated during the execution of a Triton kernel. This involves analyzing the kernel and its arguments to detect any changes. The process starts by retrieving the Triton Intermediate Representation (TTIR) of the kernel. This representation is then parsed to create a control flow graph, which is analyzed to identify any input tensor mutations. If an exception occurs during this process, it is assumed that all input tensors are mutated.

Once the mutated tensors are identified, the next step is to generate the Triton Intermediate Representation (TTIR) of the kernel. This involves using Triton's internal code generation to create the TTIR. The kernel arguments are prepared, and the kernel signature is built. The TTIR module is then generated and verified for correctness. This step ensures that the kernel's intermediate representation is accurate and ready for further processing.

# [Verifying the Model](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/795rvuez#model-verification)

After generating the TTIR, the model needs to be verified to ensure that the exported ONNX model matches the original PyTorch model. This involves exporting the model to ONNX format and comparing the outputs of the ONNX model with the original PyTorch model. The verification process checks for equivalence between the two models, ensuring that the transformation has not introduced any discrepancies.

# [Comparing ONNX and PyTorch Outputs](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/795rvuez#comparing-onnx-and-pytorch-models)

The final step in handling tensor mutations is to compare the outputs of the ONNX model with those of the PyTorch model. This involves setting up an ONNX backend session and preparing the inputs for both models. The outputs from both models are then compared to ensure they match. This step is crucial for validating that the ONNX model behaves identically to the PyTorch model, ensuring consistency and reliability in the results.
