# [Loading Arguments from a File](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/25n9b32h#loading-arguments-and-running-compilation)

The process begins by loading arguments from a specified file. This file contains the necessary inputs for the compilation process. The arguments are loaded using a method that reads the file and extracts the data, ensuring that all required inputs are available for the next steps.

# [Handling Tensor Metadata](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/25n9b32h#loading-arguments-and-running-compilation)

Once the arguments are loaded, the next step is to handle any tensor metadata. Tensor metadata includes information such as shape, stride, and data type of the tensors. This step ensures that all tensors are correctly formatted and ready for the compilation process. Handling tensor metadata is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data throughout the compilation.

# [Running the Compilation Function](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/25n9b32h#compiling-the-function-graph)

With the arguments and tensor metadata prepared, the compilation function is invoked. This function sets up the necessary context for compiling the function graph. It manages multiple context managers to ensure that the compilation environment is correctly configured. The compilation function is responsible for transforming the input arguments into a compiled function graph that can be executed efficiently.

# [Debugging and Error Handling](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/25n9b32h#wrapping-the-compiler-for-debugging)

To facilitate debugging and error handling, the compilation function is wrapped with additional debugging capabilities. This setup allows for detailed logging and error handling during the compilation process. If any issues arise, the function can dump the function graph and its state, making it easier to identify and resolve problems. This step is essential for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the compiled function.
