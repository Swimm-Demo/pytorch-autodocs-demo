# [Setting up the JIT Submodule](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/cr8su2og#initjitbindings)

The initialization process begins by setting up a submodule specifically for JIT within the main module. This submodule is essential as it isolates the JIT functionalities, making it easier to manage and extend. By creating a dedicated submodule, we ensure that all JIT-related operations are encapsulated, which simplifies debugging and enhances modularity.

# [Registering Exception Translators](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/cr8su2og#initjitbindings)

Next, we register exception translators. These translators are responsible for converting exceptions that occur during JIT compilation into a format that can be easily understood and handled by the system. This step is crucial for maintaining robustness and ensuring that any errors during JIT operations are properly managed and reported.

# [Initializing Shape Symbols](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/cr8su2og#initjitbindings)

The initialization of shape symbols follows. Shape symbols are used to represent the dimensions and shapes of tensors within the computational graph. By initializing these symbols, we ensure that the JIT compiler can accurately track and manipulate tensor shapes, which is vital for optimizing tensor operations and ensuring correct execution.

# [Configuring Graph Transformations and Optimizations](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/cr8su2og#initjitbindings)

Finally, we configure various graph transformations and optimizations. This involves setting up processes that transform the computational graph to improve performance. For example, tensor expression fusion combines multiple tensor operations into a single operation, reducing overhead and improving execution speed. Other optimizations might include eliminating dead code and common subexpressions, which further enhance the efficiency of the JIT compiler.
