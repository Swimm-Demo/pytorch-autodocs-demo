# [Initializing Convolution Parameters](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/z1138xqk#_convolution)

The convolution flow begins with setting up the necessary parameters for the convolution operation. This includes defining the stride, padding, dilation, and other relevant parameters. These parameters are essential for determining how the convolution operation will process the input data.

# [Checking Input Tensor Dimensions](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/z1138xqk#_convolution)

Next, the input tensor dimensions are checked to ensure they are compatible with the convolution operation. This step verifies that the input tensor has the correct number of dimensions and that the dimensions are appropriate for the specified convolution parameters. This ensures that the convolution operation can be performed without errors.

# [Selecting the Appropriate Backend](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/z1138xqk#_select_conv_backend)

The system then determines which backend to use for the convolution operation. Different backends, such as CuDNN, MIOpen, MKLDNN, or others, may be selected based on the input tensor, weight tensor, and convolution parameters. The selection process involves checking various conditions to choose the most suitable backend for efficient and optimized performance.

# [Performing the Convolution Operation](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBcHl0b3JjaC1hdXRvZG9jcy1kZW1vJTNBJTNBU3dpbW0tRGVtbw==/docs/z1138xqk#_convolution)

Finally, the selected backend performs the convolution operation. This step involves applying the convolution parameters to the input tensor using the chosen backend's optimized algorithms. The result is an output tensor that represents the convolved data. This output tensor is then returned as the final result of the convolution operation.
